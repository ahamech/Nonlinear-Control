# SCARA 4-DOF Robot â€“ Nonlinear Control Project

This folder contains the complete MATLAB implementation of a nonlinear control system for a 4-DOF SCARA robotic manipulator.

## âœ… Highlights
- Dynamic modeling based on Lagrangian formulation
- Controllers:
  - Feedback Linearization Control (FLC)
  - Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
- Full simulation and performance analysis
- Sensitivity analysis under parametric, initial, and disturbance variations
